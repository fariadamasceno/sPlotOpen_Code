# sPlotOpen_Code
This project documents the construction of the sPlotOpen database. The whole workflow is described in RMarkdown, which contains also code for creating figures and tables of the sister project [sPlotOpen_Manuscript](https://github.com/fmsabatini/sPlotOpen_Manuscript).

+ **html Report on database construction** at https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/fmsabatini/sPlotOpen_Code/blob/master/_public/02_BuildDataset.html

This is an initiative by [sPlot - The Global Vegetation-Plot Database](https://www.idiv.de/en/splot.html)
